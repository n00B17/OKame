# OKame

**Description:**\
This is my variation of a minikame quadruped robot thingy.
I basically wanted to have a kame like robot but utilizing a esp32 or esp8266 to be controlled via web interface.\
It seems there once were more of those kind of projects but searching the internet ended in a lot of dead links..
