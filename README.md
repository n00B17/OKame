# OKame

**Status/ Expectation Management:**\
 - I am a noob (hence the name)..
 - ..web-searched most of this (so my ability to explain is limited..)
 - ..and just started messing with github as well.
 - I played with arduino before and really hated Platformio ...initially..
 - ..but -unfortunately- it makes sense and is a lot easier when using it with the VS Code Editor and it's plugins
   

**Description:**\
This is my variation of a minikame quadruped robot thingy.
I basically wanted to have a kame like robot but utilizing an esp32 (or esp8266) to be controlled via web interface.\
It seems there once were more of those kind of projects but searching the internet ended in a lot of dead links..

**Credits:**\
Go to.. 
 - JavierIH (https://github.com/JavierIH/miniKame) for most of the code as well the stl files (I messed with those as well.. a bit)
 - MusaW for creating this here: https://www.instructables.com/Simple-NodeMCU-18-DOF-Hexapod ... from whom I stole most of the web control parts
